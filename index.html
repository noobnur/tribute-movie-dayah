    <h2> A movie you MUST watch twice - or more! </h2>
    <p> Yes, pretty girls with short skirts, katanas, guns and a caberet - everything you can wish for.
      But wait! There's more! This movie brings to life the very experience of escapism and torture. Layer after layer, Zack Synder teases our brain to believe in a fantasy and well, confuses us on which realities are really real.
      <p>Moral of the story here - only you can fight your demons. Your mind is a powerful tool - use it to your advantage. </p>
